# PugChamp
Discord bot to arrange PUGs for Overwatch

## How To
Get your own token and put it in a text file called token.txt in base folder. Should hopefully run otherwise. Done in VSS.

## TODO
```
!register btag sr role [date?](assume next pug only)(role = mt, ot, mh, oh, hs, pr, fl)
!schedule date (schedules a new pug for the date)
!pugs (lists scheduled pugs)
!puggers [date] (lists all players registered for pug w/ btaf, sr, and role)
!start (split by sr, and put members into voice channels)
!lobbies (lists lobbies with members and sr range)
!teams (lists potential teams with bench)
!seed (seeds teams based on role, prioritizing benched players first)
!rules (lists rules for pugs/pug lobby info)
```
